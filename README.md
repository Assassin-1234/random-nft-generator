creates some nice pixel art

## how to run?

- run `npm install`
- run the code using `node index.js` command
- if you dont want to use commands, you can just open the run.sh file and it'll do everything for you

## disclaimer

This would just create random pixel art everytime the script is ran, you will have to manually upload the image onto opensea or wherever you want to list it on, might integrate opensea listing soon!
